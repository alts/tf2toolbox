-- TODO --
* Sort items into classes, item slot.
* Sort metal by Ref/Rec/Scrap.
* User backpack option after the lookup list. (TF2B, OPTF2, TF2items)
* What weapons am I missing? Tool.

* Fix the CSS spaghetti :(
* _GET parameter for bbcode.
* URL shortening, get rid of .php

* Just a suggestion, wouldn't it be better to put the number of items like for example: Sandman (2) and make the "(2)" white colored for easy showing against the dark gray backround. You can also distinguish it from the same colored weapon name.
    - do this with just closing the [/color] tags.

* btw I have a unpainted as well as a TS Bills, you might want to see if there's anyway you can have them displayed separately lol

* include link to steamcommunity profile! duh.

*the some of the results are not properly nested and cause issues on some forum software this site: [b][color][/b][/color] Proper: [color][b][/b][/color] or [b][color][/color][/b] 

* Would be nice to have a "Copy BBCode Contents" button rather than 
  only having to highlight and then right-click-and-copy.
  // I TRIED THIS but most browsers don't allow JS to access the clipboard now
  // due to security reasons. You can do it in Flash but it seems like overhead
  // I don't want to try dealing with yet...
  
* If you're just using the XML to retrieve the SteamID64, you might want to consider just snipping out the ID with something like preg_match(), it'll save you having to pass the XML through utf8_encode() and assumingly SimpleXML too. 

* Offer options in Metal Maker for only showing NV, V, etc.
* Make a steam community group?
